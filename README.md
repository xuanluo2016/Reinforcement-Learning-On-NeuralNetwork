# Reinforcement-Learning-On-NeuralNetwork  

Purpose of this project:   
1, Use a neural network to replace the look-up table in training a robot based on Robocode 
2, Use a neural network which is initially trained by using the data in a trained lookup-table and then train a robot based on this neural network  

The architecture of the neural network:
